">Daily Mood Tracker Application</h1>

In this project let's build an **Daily Mood Tracker Application** by applying the concepts we have learned till now. This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned till React Course and apply them in a concrete project.

You will demonstrate your skills by creating an app that will fetch data from an internal server using a component, routing concepts, authentication and authorization, and adding responsiveness to the website

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. You can request for the feedback after your project submission in the discussions.

The key components and functionalities of this project include:

- **User Interface**: I created distinct pages for Login, Item Details using React components. These components leverage React's capabilities for handling props, state management, event handling, and form inputs.
- **Authentication**: Users can log in by providing their username and password. The application then performs an HTTP API call for login authentication. Upon successful login, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated and stored in the client's storage. This token is subsequently included in the headers of API requests to authorize the user.
- **Routing**: To ensure a seamless user experience, I implemented routing using React Router components such as Route, Switch, and Link.
- **Security**: I established security measures by implementing protected routes. If a user attempts to access Home details routes without proper authentication, they are automatically redirected to the Login page.

**Technologies used**: React JS, JS, CSS, Routing, REST API Calls, Local Storage, Cookies, JWT Token, Authorization, Authentication
